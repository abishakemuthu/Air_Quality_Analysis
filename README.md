### Problem Statement

Air pollution is a critical environmental issue affecting the health and well-being of millions of people in India. Given India's rapid urbanization and industrial growth, monitoring and analyzing the air quality trends is essential for government agencies and public environmental organizations. Effective analysis can lead to better-informed decisions regarding public health, policy-making and urban planning.

### Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive Business Intelligence (BI) solution that provides actionable insights to the stakeholders to understand the patterns and causes of air pollution, identifing high-risk areas and assess the effectiveness of pollution control measures over time.

### Business Insights

- The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a key indicator used to measure how polluted the air is.
- We can see that overall air quality is improving over the period of time, as the AQI is getting low. So, we can say our current policy is working good.
- We can see that Ahmedabad, Delhi and Patna are the top three polluted cities, so we should impose better policy on them.
- We can see that Coimbatore, Shillong and Aizawal are the least polluted cities.
- We can see the average PM2.5, Carbon Mono Oxide, Nitrogen oxide and Sulpher di oxide present in the air which is very harmful.
